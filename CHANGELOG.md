### Breaking Changes

* In Stream.bindLifecycle,
  The parameter repeatLastOnRestart is deprecated.
  A new parameter repeatLastOnStateAtLeast.
  The default value of the state parameter is changed from LifecycleState.started to
  LifecycleState.created, aligning with the behavior of other bind methods.

## 2.2.1

* Fix the bug of repeatLatest done.

## 2.2.0

* The repeatOnLifecycle and collectOnLifecycle functions are extended to support error handling for
  the execution block via a new parameter called ignoreBlockError.
  By default, ignoreBlockError is set to false, meaning any errors occurring in the block will be
  reported using FlutterError.reportError.
* In the extension functions withLifecycleEffect and withLifecycleAndDataEffect, if an exception
  occurs in the execution units, FlutterError.reportError will be called.
* ILifecycle adds new extensions: whenLifecycleStateAtLeast, whenLifecycleStateXXX,
  whenLifecycleNextEvent, whenLifecycleNextEventXXX. These methods return a Future<Cancellable>,
  making them convenient for use in asynchronous operations.
